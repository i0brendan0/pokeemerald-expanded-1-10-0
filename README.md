### pokeemerald Expansion configuration changes

    - Critical hits do 2x damage instead of 1.5x.
    - Trainers give boosted EXP compared to wild Pokemon.
    - Pokemon receive split EXP instead of full EXP if multiple participated.
    - Pokemon do not get a bonus to EXP when above the level they would evolve at.
    - Obtained badges boost stats.
    - Binding damage does 1/16th damage each turn instead of 1/8th.
    - Hidden Power uses IVs to determine power.
    - Rough Skin/Iron Barb damage is 1/16th instead of 1/8th.
    - Dark Type Pokemon are no longer immune to moves affected by Prankster. Dark types just nullify the priority boost.
    - Roost will make a pure Flying-type Pokemon typless instead of Normal.
    - Binding moves last for 2-5 turns instead of 4-5 turns.
    - Uproar lasts for 2-5 turns instead of 3 turns.
    - Hi-Jump Kick does recoil damage based on the damage done, not a flat amount based off the user's HP.
    - Conversion picks a move at random instead of only the first move.
    - Spite reduces PP by 2-5 instead of 4.
    - Sheer Cold has normal accuracy if the user is not Ice type.
    - Rapid Spin does not increase speed.
    - Minimize only increases evasion by 1 stage instead of 2.
    - Hi-Jump Kick will not recoil if the target is immune.
        - My reasoning is they still hit the target but it does no damage.
    - Damaging healing moves won't heal the user that's under the effect of Heal Block.
        - The move will still damage the opponent.
    - Teleport functions normally instead of allowing the user to switch out.
    - Dark Void will not fail if used by any Pokemon besides Darkrai.
    - Weather abilities will last until the weather is changed instead of 5 turns.
    - Nest Ball's catch rate is based off of Gen 5.
    - Sport Ball has a catch rate of 1.5x instead of 1x.
    - Serene Grace will not boost the chance of flinching from Razor Fang or King's Rock.
    - Health recovery items heal as they would pre-Gen 7.
    - Incense items work for breeding as they would normally instead of having no effect.
        - New items will be added for use with Beta Mon.

### Notable Bug Fixes

    - RNG will now be seeded like it should.
    - Pokedex entries will not show without the Pokedex.
